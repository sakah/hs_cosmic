== done == Modify xtcurve.h/cc and run.cc for both cases; constant drift velocity and xt_param_path
== done == Check root with modified code
== done == Find the reason why xt_curve_pol4 is very slow => Fill into tx_left/right_[cid][ns] and use it in XTcurve::GetR
== done == There is sharp peak at hitR=8mm => bug of if condition
== done == Found that different t0 makes another local minimum.. Broad residual at layer=2 is caused by this reason => cannot solve tangents with two layers in even layers (if test_cid=2, cid=1,3,4,5,6,7 is used so only two layers cid=4,6 are used. Same case for other even layers)
