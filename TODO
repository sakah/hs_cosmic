== done == Modify xtcurve.h/cc and run.cc for both cases; constant drift velocity and xt_param_path
== done == Check root with modified code
== done == Find the reason why xt_curve_pol4 is very slow => Fill into tx_left/right_[cid][ns] and use it in XTcurve::GetR
There is sharp peak at hitR=8mm
Found that different t0 makes another local minimum.. Broad residual at layer=2 is caused by this reason
